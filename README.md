# email_client

An email client is a program that lives on your computer and lets you send, receive and manage your emails. 
Typical examples include Outlook and Windows Live Mail. 
Email clients give you the freedom of handling the mails in a more efficient way. 
An email client isn't the same as an email server, however; the latter is the hardware that transports and stores mail centrally for an email provider's many users.
